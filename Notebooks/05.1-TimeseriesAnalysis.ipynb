    "Time series analysis is a rich field, envolving extensive mathematical analysis. Since our time is limited, we will try to learn the importance of time series analysis with an intuitive acoustic example.\n",

    "Sound waves are used so we can identify frequency components in a way other than graphical. The 440 Hz note corresponds to the [pitch used as the de facto musical reference for tunning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440_(pitch_standard)).\n",

    "To define a monochromatic signal (a one-frequency signal), of course, the __frequency (f)__ itself, and the __amplitude (A)__ of the signal. We also need a __phase ($\\phi$)__ that gives the delay of the wave. At the instant of time __t__ our wave looks like:\n",
